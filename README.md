# Solis Inverter and EPM w/ ESPHome

This is a fork of [this repository](https://github.com/hn/ginlong-solis), with certain removals and additions to fit my own use case.

The ESPHome base config has been changed to work with the ESP32, see `solis-esphome-esp32.yaml`.

For a full write up (and additional resources including connector 3D models), see [this blogpost](https://insertnewline.com/blog/Solis-solar-esphome/).
